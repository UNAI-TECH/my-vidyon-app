# 🔄 Applying Translations Across All Dashboards

I'm now updating ALL dashboard pages and components to use translations. This will make the language selector work across the entire application.

## Progress:

### ✅ Already Complete:
- Login Page
- DashboardLayout (header with language selector)

### 🔄 Currently Updating:
- Student Dashboard
- Faculty Dashboard  
- Institution Dashboard
- Admin Dashboard
- All student pages (Courses, Timetable, Attendance, etc.)
- All faculty pages
- All institution pages
- All admin pages

### Strategy:
1. Add `useTranslation()` hook to each component
2. Replace hardcoded text with translation keys
3. Test each dashboard to ensure translations work

This will take a few moments...
